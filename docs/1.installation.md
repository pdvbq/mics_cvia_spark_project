# ⚙️ Installation

This guide is meant to help you install and use the project. We offer 2 main ways you can install using 2 different package managers.
The first package manager is [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which is the new kid in the block. For the second, we have Conda.

## Install with UV (Recommenced)

!!! warning

    In order to use UVs package manager, please make sure to install it. You can
    find installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
    In case you are using Linux/MacOS, you can run the following command:

    ```sh
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

1.  Go to project root
2.  Install project dependencies

    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

!!! tip

    You can additionally create a python virtual environment from UV.
    Just run `uv venv` which create a `.venv` environment. Then just run
    `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate or `deactive` for deactivating the environment.

## Install with Conda

!!! warning

    Conda can be installed as a minimal package by following the guide [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

Upon cloning the repository, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` while inside the repository. Once the environment is set up, activate it with `conda activate spark`.
